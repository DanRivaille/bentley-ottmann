This program is part of the assessment work of the course "12RNA - Robust Numerical Algorithms" lectured at FNSPE CTU in Prague.

Java implementation of Bentleyâ€“Ottmann sweep line algorithm for listing all crossings in a set of line segments.

The algorithm, as described by Bentley and Ottmann, assumes that **4 following conditions are satisfied**:

1. line segments are not vertical
2. line segment endpoints do not lie on other line segments
3. crossings are formed by only two line segments
4. no two event points have the same x-coordinate
