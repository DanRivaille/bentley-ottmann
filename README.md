# bentley-ottmann

This program is part of the assessment work of the course "12RNA - Robust Numerical Algorithms" lectured at FNSPE CTU in Prague.

Java implementation of Bentleyâ€“Ottmann sweep line algorithm for listing all crossings in a set of line segments. The aplication contains a simple GUI.

The algorithm, as described by Bentley and Ottmann, assumes that the **following conditions are satisfied**:

1. No two line segment endpoints or crossings have the same x-coordinate
2. No line segment endpoint lies upon another line segment
3. No three line segments intersect at a single point.
